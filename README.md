# Proposal for funding the development of CurveDocs (in-progress)

# Sentence Summary

CurveDocs requests funding the [CurveDocs 2-of-5 Multisig](https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=eth:0x960B77DAf61Ac184D396db23A77Ec391c9454605) with a grant amount of USD 144,000 or 320,000 CRV tokens at a rate of 0.45 USD per CRV token, for 12 months to hire two full-time paid maintainers for maintaining [Curve Docs](https://www.docs.curve.fi), [Curve Resources](https://www.resources.curve.fi) and Curve Notebooks (a collection of Jupyter Notebooks that interactively explain Curve contracts).

# History of Grant Applications

CurveDocs, currently comprising one full-time paid maintainer and a part-time unpaid advisor, was [previously awarded 100,000 CRV tokens](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xddfc04666662bc94ab00520020dbce5502f8168076b0752cdbeea861abcde9e4) estimated at approximat3ely USD 80,000. The maintainer(s) (starting with two contributors and eventually one full-time contributor) set out to create and maintain [Curve Docs](https://www.docs.curve.fi) and [Curve Resources](https://www.resources.curve.fi), among other significant contributions.

As of date, approximately USD 20,000 remains. These funds can sustain current work for approximately four more months.

# Proposal Details


Planning

continue working on technical documentation, as some things are not covered yet (x-gov, x-dao, upcoming lending, etcâ€¦)
development of a hub to host interactive notebooks designed for easy access and contribution. A first rough version can be found here (https://github.com/CurveDocs/curve-notebook/tree/twocrypto-ng). The notebooks will focus on:
Smart Contract Navigation: showcasing smart contract functionalities. Additionally, with the recently added support of titanoboa for Google Colab, creating easy-to-use notebooks to create e.g. DAO votes sound very appealing.
Analysis/Research:  data analysis and research notebooks, CurveResearch whitepapers/yellowpapers, etc.
creating resources to simplify working with Curve contracts. Up until now, there are no good resources on how to integrate stuff from Curve, especially for crucial components such as oracles.

Documentation Management
The repository will be hosted on the CurveDocs organization: https://github.com/CurveDocs 
Technical docs: https://docs.curve.fi/ 
Resources: https://resources.curve.fi/ 


# Achievements

Progress
Initial contributors:

Mo: https://github.com/mo-anon
Marco: https://github.com/MarcoWorms
After the first two months of collaboration, Mo took on the project independently, continuing to develop and expand CurveDocs.
Curve Resources
transitioned the documentation platform from GitBook to MkDocs and gave it a new look
made continuous changes/updates throughout the existing documentation and added new sections for previously undocumented features like crvUSD.
Curve Technical Documentation
migrated existing documentation from ReadTheDocs to MkDocs, essentially rebuilding the entire documentation to address previous incompleteness.
Key Updates Include:
CurveDAO: coverage of all relevant core contracts.
StableswapExchange: overhaul of the existing Stableswap documentation, and adding stableswap-ng.
CryptoSwap: added regular cryptoswap, tricrypto-ng, and twocrypto-ng (pretty much done) documentation.
crvUSD: added technical documentation for all relevant contracts.
Pool Factory: Added detailed overviews for all factories, deployment apis, etc.
Metaregistry 
new section dedicated to public audits, whitepapers, and a comprehensive list of deployed contracts.
